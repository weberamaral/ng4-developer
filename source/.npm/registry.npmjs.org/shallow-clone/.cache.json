So any objects in the array will still not be cloned (e.g. they will be the same object as in the orginal array).\n\n```js\nvar arr = [{ 'a': 0 }, { 'b': 1 }]\nvar foo = clone(arr);\n// foo =>  [{ 'a': 0 }, { 'b': 1 }]\n\n// array is cloned\nassert.equal(actual === expected, false);\n\n// array elements are not\nassert.deepEqual(actual[0], expected[0]); // true\n```\n\n## returns primitives as-is\n\n```js\nclone(0)\n//=> 0\n\nclone('foo')\n//=> 'foo'\n```\n\n## shallow clone a regex\n\n```js\nclone(/foo/g)\n//=> /foo/g\n```\n\n## shallow clone an object\n\n```js\nclone({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 })\n//=> {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }\n```\n\n## Related projects\n\n* [assign-deep](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/assign-deep): Deeply assign the enumerable properties of source objects to a destination object.\n* [clone-deep](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/clone-deep): Recursively (deep) clone JavaScript native types, like Object, Array, RegExp, Date as well as primitives.\n* [extend-shallow](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/extend-shallow): Extend an object with the properties of additional objects. node.js/javascript util.\n* [is-plain-object](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/is-plain-object): Returns true if an object was created by the `Object` constructor.\n* [mixin-object](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/mixin-object): Mixin the own and inherited properties of other objects onto the first object.

Like merge-deep, but doesn't clone.\n\n## Running tests\n\nInstall dev dependencies:\n\n```sh\n$ npm i -d && npm test\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests and stars are always welcome.

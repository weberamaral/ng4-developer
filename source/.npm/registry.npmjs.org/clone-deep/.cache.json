Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/jonschlinkert/clone-deep.svg?style=flat&label=Travis)](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/clone-deep)\n\n> Recursively (deep) clone JavaScript native types, like Object, Array, RegExp, Date as well as primitives.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save clone-deep\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar cloneDeep = require('clone-deep');\n\nvar obj = {a: 'b'};\nvar arr = [obj];\n\nvar copy = cloneDeep(arr);\nobj.c = 'd';\n\nconsole.log(copy);\n//=> [{a: 'b'}]\n\nconsole.log(arr);\n//=> [{a: 'b', c: 'd'}]\n```\n\n## Heads up!\n\nThe `instanceClone` function is invoked to clone objects that are not \"plain\" objects (as defined by [isPlainObject](#isPlainObject)`isPlainObject`) if it is provided. If `instanceClone` is not specified, it will not attempt to clone non-plain objects, and will copy the object reference.\n\n## Attribution\n\nBased on [mout's](https://github.com/mout/mout) implementation of deepClone.\n\n## About\n\n### Contributing\n\nPull requests and stars are always welcome. For bugs and feature requests, [please create an issue](../../issues/new).\n\n### Building docs\n\n_(This project's readme.md is generated by [verb](https://github.com/verbose/verb-generate-readme), please don't edit the readme directly. Any changes to the readme must be made in the [.verb.md](.verb.md) readme template.)_\n\nTo generate the readme, run the following command:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install -g verbose/verb#dev verb-generate-readme && verb\n```\n\n### Running tests\n\nRunning and reviewing unit tests is a great way to get familiarized with a library and its API. You can install dependencies and run tests with the following command:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install && npm test\n```\n\n### Author\n\n**Jon Schlinkert**\n\n* [github/jonschlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert)\n* [twitter/jonschlinkert](https://twitter.com/jonschlinkert)\n\n### License\n\nCopyright © 2017, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert).\nReleased under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n\n***\n\n_This file was generated by [verb-generate-readme](https://github.com/verbose/verb-generate-readme), v0.6.0, on May 19, 2017._","maintainers":[{"name":"jonschlinkert","email":"github@sellside.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-05-19T18:03:51.107Z","created":"2014-10-02T22:52:50.065Z","0.1.0":"2014-10-02T22:52:50.065Z","0.1.1":"2014-10-02T23:16:51.310Z","0.2.0":"2015-06-29T08:24:27.825Z","0.2.1":"2015-08-10T21:14:43.849Z","0.2.2":"2015-08-21T08:20:50.659Z","0.2.3":"2015-10-10T20:47:39.683Z","0.2.4":"2015-12-23T18:53:51.976Z","0.3.0":"2017-05-19T18:03:51.107Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jonschlinkert/clone-deep","keywords":["array","clone","clone-array","clone-array-deep","clone-date","clone-deep","clone-object","clone-object-deep","clone-reg-exp","date","deep","exp","for","for-in","for-own","javascript","mixin","mixin-object","object","own","reg","util","utility"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/jonschlinkert/clone-deep.git"},"author":{"name":"Jon Schlinkert","url":"https://github.com/jonschlinkert"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jonschlinkert/clone-deep/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","license":"MIT","users":{"basilvalentine":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"591f3387-3eaf\"","_lastModified":"Fri, 19 May 2017 18:03:51 GMT"}
